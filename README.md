# Wi-Fi Sensing Site A Experiments

Public measured data from the legacy `AC` operational Wi-Fi sensing series at
an anonymized site. The public identifier `site-a` deliberately does not reveal
the private location identity. `AC` bundle IDs remain stable provenance IDs and
are not part of the legacy `D` series.

The repository publishes sanitized measurements, integrity ledgers, bounded
analysis, and the sanitizers needed to reconstruct the public representation
from an authorized private archive. The existing production Wi-Fi network was
observed as natural interference and was not reconfigured for these runs.

## Published experiments

### AC01 — 24-hour natural-operation baseline

- [Dataset](datasets/ac01_natural_operation_baseline_20260812T142321Z/)
- Duration: 24 hours.
- Topology: one Raspberry Pi 5 collector and one ESP32-S3 CSI sensor.
- Surface: 2,878,787 envelopes in 288 finalized chunks, collector events,
  host-health records, and timing/stability analysis.
- Supported evidence: long-run continuity, integrity, 32-bit ESP timestamp
  rollover handling, transport-failure discrimination, and natural RF
  variability.
- Boundary: no human-presence or activity labels; this is not occupancy or
  classification-accuracy evidence.

### AC02 — failure-aware adaptive sensing with prplOS context

- [Dataset](datasets/ac02_failure_aware_adaptive_prplos_20260813T173202Z/)
- Duration: 17.47 hours; 34.93 aggregate node-hours.
- Topology: two Raspberry Pi 5 collectors, two ESP32-S3 CSI sensors, and
  read-only context from a separate prplOS AP.
- Surface: 5,076,207 public envelopes, controller decisions, health and link
  records, parsed prplOS context, and a ten-trial physical-reset ledger.
- Supported evidence: multi-node timing/failure discrimination, controlled
  reset detection and recovery, cooperative admission, policy-budget
  accounting, and read-only prplOS integration.
- Boundary: the run contains no successful configuration actuation, causal QoS
  improvement, completed method-block comparison, C5/5 GHz CSI, or labelled
  human activity.

### AC03 — multiband endurance and live timing audit

- [Dataset](datasets/ac03_multiband_endurance_prplos_20260814T135053Z/)
- Duration: 20 hours per S3 node plus an independent 18-hour C5 stream; 58
  aggregate sensor-hours.
- Topology: two Raspberry Pi 5 collectors, two 2.4 GHz ESP32-S3 sensors, one
  data-producing 5 GHz ESP32-C5 sensor, and read-only prplOS context.
- Surface: 6,298,362 public envelopes (6,290,250 finalized), 6,248,549
  finalized valid CSI records, controller decisions, host/link telemetry, and
  a record-level live false-reset audit.
- Supported evidence: autonomous multiband endurance, archive integrity,
  rollover discrimination, invalid-timing exclusion, policy-budget accounting,
  and read-only prplOS integration.
- Boundary: live timestamp-only reset inference was invalidated by UDP record
  ordering; there was no controlled fault campaign, successful actuation,
  completed rate/method comparison, paired-C5 stream, or labelled activity.

## Identifier convention

- `ACNN`: stable public experiment code within this dataset series.
- `YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ`: UTC collection-start suffix.

Identifiers describe this repository only. Detailed topology and condition are
recorded in each bundle's `metadata.json` rather than encoded in the folder
name.

## Evidence and privacy boundary

Included data preserve timestamps, sequence and epoch fields, channel/rate/RSSI
measurements, CSI values, controller decisions, and event timing. Credentials,
concrete SSIDs, IP/MAC/BSSID values, hostnames, board serials, device paths,
exact site identity, and private control arguments are excluded or replaced by
stable public labels. See the dataset policy and each bundle's claim boundary
before using the data in a publication.

## Reuse

Original source code is available under the MIT License. Original published
data and documentation are available under CC BY 4.0. See
[the license and attribution terms](LICENSE.md) for the exact scope; the
privacy and scientific claim boundaries continue to apply.

## Independence and funding

These experiments were designed, operated, and published by an independent
individual researcher. They were self-funded and received no sponsor, grant,
commercial funding, or sponsor-directed input. References to hardware,
software, standards, or vendors identify the evaluated technical components
only and do not imply sponsorship or endorsement.
