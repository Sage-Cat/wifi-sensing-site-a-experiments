# AC01 natural-operation CSI run: 24-hour analysis

Public run `public-site-a-run-01` completed normally and spans 23.9999 observed hours.
Before sanitization, all 294 source-archive checksum entries verified; the
archive contains 288 finalized chunks and no partial chunks. The public bundle
has independently regenerated chunks, ledger hashes, and `SHA256SUMS`.

## Core results

- Envelopes: 2,878,787; structurally valid CSI: 2,861,493; malformed CSI candidates: 16 (0.000559%).
- ESP timestamp wraps: 20; non-wrap regressions: 0.
- CSI sequence-estimated missing frames: 621; duplicates: 0; regressions: 0.
- RSSI: mean -75.660 dBm, standard deviation 1.074 dB, range -96..-69 dBm.
- Longest valid-CSI ingestion gap: 32.617820 s.
- Serial transport disconnects: 1; duration 2.007604 s.
- Firmware counters between first/last heartbeats: CSI delta 2,861,995; output-drop delta 1,199.

## Archive and collector-host validation

- Chunk ledger: 288 entries, 288 complete, 288 unique paths; ledger and parsed-envelope counts differ by 0.
- Host health: 8,613 samples; 1 boot ID; clock synchronized in 8,613/8,613 samples; wall/monotonic regressions 0/0.
- Pi temperature: mean 55.79 C, maximum 60.60 C; maximum health-sample gap 12.588 s.
- Pi one-minute load: mean 0.218, maximum 1.058; minimum free storage 22.71 GiB.
- Wi-Fi interface stayed up in 8,613/8,613 samples; Ethernet stayed down in 8,613/8,613 samples.

## Failure-aware interpretation

- The 20 ESP 32-bit microsecond-clock wraps with zero non-wrap regressions are a natural-run validation of rollover handling, not reboot events.
- The sole 2.008-second transport interruption reconnected without changing the firmware boot epoch; it is therefore a serial-path failure, not evidence of an ESP reboot.
- The longest CSI-only silence was 32.618 seconds, while the longest gap across every envelope was 6.767 seconds. Heartbeats continued through part of the CSI silence, allowing sensing-path loss to be distinguished from complete node loss.
- Collector source-sequence continuity is exact. CSI sequence gaps and the firmware output-drop counter are separate observations and must not be added as though they identify the same lost frames.
- The reported noise floor is invariant, so it is retained for provenance but is not a useful time-varying interference covariate in this run.

## Interpretation boundary

This is an unlabelled natural-operation RF/CSI dataset. It supports stability, continuity, timing-wrap, signal-variation, and data-quality claims; it does not establish human occupancy or activity-classification accuracy.
The hourly edge bins are partial clock hours, so their nominal per-hour rates are not comparable to complete middle hours without duration normalization.
CSI amplitude features are computed from a deterministic 1-in-100 envelope sample; RSSI, continuity, timing, and validity statistics use every archived record.
